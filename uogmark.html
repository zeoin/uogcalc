				<h3>Calculator</h3>
				<p>Its that time of year again and people are coming to the end of their respective degrees, eager to find out what sort of mark they will be looking at getting for all their hard work.</p>
				<p>Even though you may have recived all your marks, atleast provisonally, you may find yourself waiting a while for your official degree classification as it goes through the Board of Examiners. Information is available on exactly how they calculate this, which I have made into this calculator so you can work it out yourself quickly and easily as it can get quite confusing.</p>

			<p>In calculating the classification band in which a student falls, the Board of Examiners 
			will use two methods. The method giving the higher result will be used to determine 
			the classification.</p>

			<u>Method 1 </u>
			 
			<p>This is based on the average of the best grades at the level of the award amounting to 
			90 CATS, rounded to the nearest whole number. If the rounded average is within 1% 
			of a classification threshold (50, 60 or 70%), the student will be upgraded to the higher 
			class if both of the following criteria are met:</p>
			 
			<p>a. there are marks for at least 60 CATS (e.g., 4 single modules) at Level 6 in the higher 
			class;</p>
			 
			<p>b. there are marks for no more than 30 CATS (e.g., 2 single modules) at Level 6 in the 
			mark range of the class below that of the rounded average.</p>
			 
			<p>In the case of a student with ungraded credit at Level 6, method 1 may be used 
			provided there are grades for modules worth 75 CATS points.</p>
			 
			<u>Method 2</u> 
			 
			<p>This is based on the average (not rounded) of the best grades at the level one below 
			that of the award amounting to 90 CATS, weighted at 40%, plus the average (not 
			rounded) of the best grades at the level of the award amounting to 90 CATS, weighted 
			at 60%, rounded to the nearest whole number. If the rounded average is within 1% of 
			a classification threshold (50, 60 or 70%), the student will be upgraded to the higher 
			class if both of the following criteria are met:</p>
			 
			<p>a. there are marks for at least 120 CATS at both levels in the higher class;</p>
			 
			<p>b. there are marks for no more than 60 CATS at both levels in the mark range of the 
			class below that of the rounded average.</p>
			 
			<p>In the case of a student with ungraded credit at the level one below that of the award, 
			method 2 may be used provided there are grades for modules worth 60 CATS points.</p>
